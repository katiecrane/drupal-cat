## Instructions

1. Spin up a Drupal 7 site, hosting it on Pantheon—it’s free, and we’ll be using it for some of our work this year.
2. Create a sample page and a sample article with dummy content of your choice.
3. Write a module that grabs a random cat image from the Google API.
   You can use this url to get cat images
   http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/images?v=1.0&q=cat&rsz=8&safe=active
4. Display a random cat image on every article, but not on pages.
5. Create an admin settings page in the to allow images of cats to be replaced images of whatever animal the user wants. This should only be accessible by admins.
